# Star-Wars-Data
Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.
-https://www.swapi.tech/api

Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

Some interactivity is required. This interactivity needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

-Event Listener 1:
User clicks on something from the dropdown menu to retrieve and display information about:
Films: more specifically details about each film

Event Listener 2:
User Decides whether they "like" the film or not using a checkbox

Event Listener 3:
User clicks a "Start Over" button to clear screen and start over

To start over:
1) I could display the posters from each film and you click on an image to get info.  The info about the film displayed could be in a card below the film.
2) User could have a like button on the card.
3) User can drag and drop the image to a smaller rendering to rank you favorite movies in order.
