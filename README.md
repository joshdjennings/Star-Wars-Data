# Star Wars Movie Info App

This is my Vanilla JS Phase 1 project. I used HTML, Javascript, CSS, and Bootstrap to pull data from a public API. The web address for my API is: https://www.swapi.tech/

## Description

My app can allow users to get some basic information about the star wars movies that they may not have known about previously.

### Choose a Movie

User clicks on a movie from the dropdown menu to retrieve and display information about:
their selected movie. Details about each film will be displayed in a card on screen. The User can choose a different movie anytime from the menu. "Change" event.

### Clear the movie infor to start over

User can click on Yoda's quote to clear the movie card and the comment card. "Click" event.

## Leave a Comment

User can post a comment and see it displayed on in a card after they "Submit" it. Comments will remain even if users cycle through different movies' information until the Yoda button is clicked. "Submit" event.
